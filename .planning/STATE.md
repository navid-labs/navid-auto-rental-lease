# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** K Car 수준의 프로덕션급 UI/UX로 전환하여 투자자/고객 신뢰도 확보
**Current focus:** Phase 13 complete, ready for Phase 14 - Vehicle Detail Page

## Current Position

Phase: 13 of 17 (Component Foundation) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 (done)
Status: Phase 13 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-19 -- Completed 13-02 design tokens and format utilities

Progress: [██████████] 100% (Phase 13)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0 + v1.1 baseline):**
- Total plans completed: 28
- Average duration: ~4.4min per plan
- Total execution time: ~1.08 hours

**By Phase (v2.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 13-01 | 2 | 3min | 1.5min |
| 13-02 | 2 | 2min | 1.0min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0 Roadmap]: 5 phases (13-17) derived from 34 requirements in 5 categories
- [v2.0 Roadmap]: Component Foundation first -- all packages/tokens before page work
- [v2.0 Roadmap]: Vehicle Detail before Search -- higher complexity, sets component patterns
- [v2.0 Roadmap]: Phase 15 and 16 can run after Phase 14 (partial parallelism possible)
- [v2.0 Roadmap]: Kakao Maps deferred to v3.0 -- API key registration required, isolated risk
- [13-01]: Added @testing-library/dom as missing peer dep for @testing-library/react
- [13-01]: Polyfill Element.getAnimations in test env for base-ui ScrollArea compatibility
- [13-02]: Badge tokens reuse existing accent hsl for info/price consistency
- [13-02]: VehicleNameInput type mirrors Prisma nested include pattern for zero-mapping usage
- [13-02]: formatKoreanDate is strict alias (===) for formatDate, not a wrapper

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- PDF generation Vercel serverless timeout -- carried from v1.0, needs Vercel Pro or Edge Function
- Vehicle body SVG source -- need to inspect K Car HTML or source generic car silhouette before Phase 14
- K Car design token extraction -- 30min DevTools inspection needed before Phase 13
